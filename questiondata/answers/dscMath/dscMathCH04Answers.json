  "04_02": "Injective (one-to-one) means no two elements of A map to the same element of B. For instance, f(x) = x+1 on integers is injective.",
  "04_03": "Surjective (onto) means every element of B is hit by some element in A. For example, f(x) = x^3 from ℝ to ℝ is surjective.",
  "04_04": "A bijection is both injective and surjective: it matches each element of A to a unique element of B, and every B gets hit.",

  "04_06": "A relation is reflexive if every element relates to itself, so (a, a) is always present.",

  "04_08": "Transitive means if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. For example, 'less than or equal' is transitive.",

  "04_10": "An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.",

  "04_12": "f(x) = 1/x is defined for all real numbers except 0, because division by zero is undefined.",

  "04_24": "x ≠ y is NOT reflexive, since for any x, x ≠ x is false.",
  "04_25": "With fewer domain elements than codomain, a function can be injective (but not surjective). Example: f(x)=x from A={1,2} to B={1,2,3}.",
  "04_26": "This property is the definition of injectivity (one-to-one): f(x)=f(y) only if x=y.",
  "04_27": "Symmetric means if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) is in R. Example: friendship is symmetric.",
